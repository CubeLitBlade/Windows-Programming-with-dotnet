## Introduction
Hey, guys! We meet again! As you can see, this repository contains my solution to topics of "Windows Programming" for Hubei University. Each project is a possible version to some classic problem. If you want to learn to use C Sharp(C#) and dotnet Framework(.NET Framwork) for Windows development and already have some programming experience. This solution may help you to start. Of course, each project is not very difficult, so please use it only as a primer. In addition, I want each project to accomplish its task relatively perfectly. However, due to limited personal ability, some problems are not well solved, and I keep them in the comments. If you have a good idea, please share it. Let's make progress together. 

## How to use it?
### File structure
Each folder numbered "X-X" is a separate project and each project is designed to accomplish a specific topic. The corresponding topic will be presented as "**Topic.md**" in the project.

## Get this repository
### Clone with Git
If you have installed **Git**, just run the following command in **Terminal**. 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/CubeLitBlade/Windows-Programming-with-dotnet.git
```

### Clone with Visual Studio
If you have installed **Visual Studio**, **copy** the following url first. 
```bash
https://github.com/CubeLitBlade/Windows-Programming-with-dotnet.git
```
Then run Visual Studio, click "**Clone a repository**" on the welcome page. Then paste the url into "**Repositoty location**", set the storage path and click "**Clone**". 

### Download zip directly
If you just want to download it, click "**<> Code**" on the repository page and then click "**Download ZIP**". 

## Environment
With the following environment, these programs run normally. 
|Item  |Environment                           |
| :--: | :----------------------------------: |
|System|Microsoft Windows 11                  |
|IDE   |Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2022|
|.NET  |.NET Framework 4.8                    |

*The .NET Framework is falling out of support. If you are using Visual Studio, you will be able to upgrade to latest .NET, see [Overview of the .NET Upgrade Assistant](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/porting/upgrade-assistant-overview?WT.mc_id=dotnet-35129-website) for more details.*
