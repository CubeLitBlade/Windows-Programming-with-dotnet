# Windows Programming with dotnet
## Introduction
Hey, guys! We meet again! As you can see, this repository contains my solution to topics of "Windows Programming" for Hubei University. Each project is a possible version to some classic problem. If you want to learn to use C Sharp(C#) and dotnet Framework(.NET Framwork) for Windows development and already have some programming experience. This solution may help you to start. Of course, each project is not very difficult, so please use it only as a primer. In addition, I want each project to accomplish its task relatively perfectly. However, due to limited personal ability, some problems are not well solved, and I keep them in the comments. If you have a good idea, please share it. Let's make progress together. 

## How to use it?
### File structure
Each folder numbered "X-X" is a separate project and each project is designed to accomplish a specific topic. The corresponding topic will be presented as a text file in the project.

## Environmet
With the following environment, these programs run normally.

If you are using Visual Studio, you would be able to upgrade them from ".NET Framework" to ".NET" if you want.
